        About Pizzeria Rustica
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Pizzeria Rustica is more than just a restaurant &mdash; it is the story
        of a family&apos;s love for authentic Italian cuisine, a tradition that
        has spanned three generations. It all began over 70 years ago when the
        Rossi family emigrated from a small town in southern Italy. With them,
        they brought cherished recipes, a passion for crafting the perfect
        pizza, and a dream to share a piece of their heritage with their new
        community.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The doors of Pizzeria Rustica first opened in 1950, in a modest, cozy
        space. Over the years, it has grown into a beloved local spot, known for
        its warm atmosphere and classic Italian dishes. Each pizza is handmade
        using time-honored techniques, the freshest ingredients, and, of course,
        a lot of love.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Today, Pizzeria Rustica is proudly run by the third generation of the
        Rossi family, who continue to uphold the values of tradition, quality,
        and community that were established decades ago. Whether you&apos;re
        enjoying our signature pizza or trying one of our house-made pasta
        dishes, you&apos;re not just getting a meal &mdash; you&apos;re becoming
        part of our family legacy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We invite you to experience the rich history and flavors of Italy, right
